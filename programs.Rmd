## **DAY 2 - Thursday October 14, 2021**

Chair: Frank Muller- Karger // Co-chair & note taker: Esteban Acevedo- Trejos

-   Breakout session 1 -- Databases: what we have and what we would like
-   Breakout session 2 -- The Value of Plankton Ecosystem Functions <br> <br>

## **DAY 1 -- Wednesday, November 3, 2021: Plankton in policy: How can we best use plankton to inform ecosystem assessments?**

-   Discussion of the value of plankton (ecological, biogeochemical, economic, recreational) <br> <br>
-   Plankton Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) and ecosystem assessments - Anthony Richardson, Lavenia Ratnaraj and Ana Lara-Lopez

\- What are ecosystem assessments?

\- Plankton EOVs -- biomass and diversity

\- Case studies that include plankton in ecosystem assessments

\- How might be we best use plankton as EOVs?

\- What are we using plankton indicators for?

\- What examples do we have of using plankton indicators from different parts of the world?

\- How can we move plankton EOVs forward?

## **DAY 2 -- Thursday November 4, 2021: Plankton in management: How can we best use plankton in models?**

-   What are the main types of plankton data and their limitations? - Jason Everett
-   Plankton in models - Heidi Pethybridge, Jenny Skerratt, Tyler Rohr
-   Approaches to standardising plankton data for use in models - Anthony Richardson:

Use of conversions; Use of statistical models

-   Making plankton data more useful for modelling

-   What examples do we have of using plankton data in models from different parts of the world?

-   How can we improve conversion tables/equations?

-   What are the different ways in which we can validate model output using plankton data?

-   How can we stimulate plankton uptake in models?
